Hey, I'm Kia! I'm a DPhil student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford, working with Fran√ßois Caron and Tom Rainforth. My research interests relate broadly to the following areas and questions:

- Scalable, reliable deep learning:
    - How can we reliably and efficiently quantify the uncertainty in neural network predictions?

- Generalization under distribution shifts:
    - How can we train models that generalize well in the presence of distribution shifts?

- Data-efficient learning:
    - How can we learn in situations where obtaining new data is expensive (active learning, semi-supervised learning)?

 Previously, I worked on analyzing the quality of variational approximations to Bayesian neural networks with [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk/) as part of my Master's at Imperial College London. Besides my academic interests, I'm also interested in EDI in, sociology and psychology. I am also currently an [MPLS EDI Fellow](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/equality-diversity-and-inclusion-in-mpls/mpls-ed-i-initiatives/mpls-ed-i-fellows) at the University of Oxford.
